# color-blox


- Render a random 10x10 grid of the following colors: yellow, red, green, and blue. 
- If a player clicks a group of two or more blocks of the same color, the group of matching blocks should be removed.
- Upon removal of the group of matching blocks, the space should be filled by the remaining blocks above shifting downward.
- Notify the player when there are no moves remaining.


Bonus Points
- Animate the blocks being removed and existing blocks moving downwards into place
- If no more moves are left but there are two or more blocks of the same color remaining, shuffle the blocks to allow the player to continue
- Add new random blocks from above when blocks shift downwards so the game is potentially infinite
- Allow the player to undo moves
